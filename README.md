Problem:
An array is a type of data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. In an array, A, of size N, each memory location has some unique index, (where 0 ≤ i ≤ N), that can be referenced as A[i](you may also see it written as Ai).

Given an array, A, of N integers, print each element in reverse order as a single line of space-separated integers.
Note: If you’ve already solved our C++ domain’s Arrays Introduction challenge, you may want to skip this.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer, N (the number of integers in A).
The second line contains N space-separated integers describing A.

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 103
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 104. where Ai is the ith integer in A

Output Format
Print all N integers in A in reverse order as a single line of space-separated integers.
